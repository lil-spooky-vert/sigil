Sigil is (will be) a tool/art project written in Elm and inspired by https://twitter.com/ebooks_goetia. The project aim is to 1. make cool looking stuff 2. learn Elm.

Sigil will contain a collection of functions to generate features common to occult diagrams found in _The Key of Solomon_, media like _Fullmetal Alchemist_, and the bedrooms of misunderstood teenagers the world over. The end result should create a randomly generated diagram (or "sigil") in SVG format that is sufficiently spooky/scary. These could potentially be used for aesthetic flavor for pen and paper role playing games, or questionable websites.

Stretch goals include generating brush styles, so that sigils of different styles can be generated (painted, printed, woodcut, etc), and bot functionality. Maybe this will even become a proper Elm module at some point.
